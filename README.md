# Productivity Rules for Programming.

Hello. My name is Josef Gisis and I am a software developer from New Jersey. This is a list of solutions, reminders, and suggestions to help me avoid the pitfalls I often fall into.

-   ## One Change at a Time.

    When troubleshooting a problem, try not to make more than one change at a time as it may obfuscate the cause of the bug. By controlling changes, you can easily track what works and what doesn't.

-   ## Stop and Think.

    Pride and irritation clouds your judgement. Rather than attempting to storm the fortress again and again, stop, back-off, and try to calmly assess the situation.

-   ## Read.

    Although it is tempting to try to figure things out through trial and error, it is an inefficient and frustrating way to find the solution. Take a break and look up examples, documentation, and best practices.

-   ## Take Breaks.

    Trying to work when mentally fatigued leads to poor productivity. Taking a quick break may end up saving you more time in the long run.

-   ## Shift Focus.

    If you are hitting a wall, you may need a fresh perspective. Shift focus to another part of the project and later you can return with a renewed view.

-   ## Ask for Help.

-   ## Be Flexible:

    The sunken cost fallacy prevents you from letting go of things you have spent time or money on even if they will end up costing you more time and money in the long run. This is also true in programming where you may not want to start over because of the amount of work you put in. However, the time is gone and you can't get it back, so be flexible and try something else. You may end up saving more time in the end.

-   ## Learn New Skills.

    Take some time to improve or learn new skills. Your new skills will significantly increase your productivity.

-   ## Draw a Graph.

    Thoughts can be finicky; write the logic down or draw a flowchart to solidify your thoughts and visually study them.

-   ## Don't Cheap Out.

    Spend as much time as needed to build a solid foundation for your app following best practices and design patterns. This will make your app easier to extend and modify. Your future self will thank you.

-   ## Don't Get Caught on the Details.

    Before getting into the nitty gritty details of you code, try to get its general structure and logic in place. If your app's structure is robust and clear, all the details will fall into place. Before spending time on refining you code and adding documentation, make sure it actually works and that your program's structure will remain relatively stable; otherwise, your work may be for naught.

-   ## More Documentation is Better than Less.

    While the code may be obvious to you now, you will probably forget a lot of it pretty soon. It is especially important to leave documentation for code that solves some non-obvious issue because you may delete it later when you have forgotten why it was there. Plus it never hurts to have more documentation (unless it is inaccurate).

-   ## Don't make the same mistake twice.

    You can stay positive knowing all your mistakes and detours are a lesson; that is, if you actually learn from you mistakes.

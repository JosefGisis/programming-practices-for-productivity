# Productivity Rules for Programming.

-   ## One change at a time:

    When troubleshooting a problem, try not to make more than one change at a time as it may obfuscate the cause of the bug. By controlling changes, you can easily track what works and what doesn't.

-   ## Stop and think:

    Pride and irritation clouds your judgement. Rather than attempting to storm the fortress again and again, stop, back-off, and try to calmly assess the situation.

-   ## Read.

    Although it is tempting to try to solve an issue through trial and error, it is an inefficient and frustrating way to find the solution. Take a break and look up examples, documentation, and best practices.

-   ## Take breaks.

    Trying to work when mentally fatigued leads to poor productivity. Taking a quick break may end up saving you more time in the long run.

-   ## Shift focus.

    If you are hitting a wall, you may need a fresh perspective. Shift focus to another part of the project and later you can return with a renewed view.

-   ## Ask for help.

-   ## Be flexible:

    Don't let the sunken cost fallacy prevent you from starting over or adopting a new approach when your current solution is untenable.

-   ## Learn new skills.

    Take some time to improve or learn new skills. Your new skills will significantly increase your productivity.

-   ## Draw a graph.

    Thoughts can be finicky; write the logic down or draw a flowchart to solidify your thoughts and visually study them.

-   ## Don't cheap out:

    spend as much time as needed to build a solid foundation for your app following best practices and design patterns. Your future self will thank you.

-   ## Don't make the same mistake twice.

    You can stay positive knowing all your mistakes and detours are a lesson; that is, if you actually learn from you mistakes.

-   ## Don't spend to9 much time on a solution before you know it works.
